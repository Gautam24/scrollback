Connecting, disconnecting, entering and leaving:
- When websockets disconnects, it should wait 1 minute, then part the channel.
- If reconnected within 1 minute, it shouldn't part the channel.
- If multiple tabs are open, it shouldn't part the channel until last tab is closed.

Nick changes:
- When nick is changed, it should change in all chatstreams and in all IRC channels
- When there is a nick collision, it should append '1' and change on all chatstreams (and other connected servers).
- check for nick collision. Also when one of the users have changed their nick back to something else.

IRC:
- Multiple IRC channels per room
- Change nick multiple times
